Size contstant grid
Create global empty 2D array grid?

# Introduction to the game
    print: Do you want to play a game of Tic Tac Toe? 
    Answer: y/n
    If anwer is n:
        print goodbye
        end game

    print: What are your names?
    save answer: player_1, player_2

    print Welcome
    print Explanation

# Set ending variables
    Winner is false
    Tie is false
    turns is zero

# Let players take turns (alternate) - gameloop
    While winner and tie is false, and turns is not 9:
        let player take a turn
            Ask position
            Add -1 or 1
        Put in grid
        Check win condition
        turns ++1
        Switch player (modulo 2)

# no winner means tie
    print: tie

# Function: check win condition
    print: winner, ask for retry


Ideas to augment the code / game:
- Mathmetical more efficient ways to check win conditions.
- Instead of only 'y' or 'n', drop in a whole list of possible answers
- Possibility to keep score of multiple games
- Use sys module to make sure the user knows how to start the game ("Usage: python tictactoe.py") (so without any other arguments)
- Get more acquainted with pygame and classes
- unit tests
